## About

IPAPI-Ember is an app written in Ember.js that consumes an API built with Rails. This app was built as part of a final project at the [Turing School of Software & Design](http://turing.io/). Project objectives were to practice building APIs and to become familiar with a front-end JavaScript framework.
